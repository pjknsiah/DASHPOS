// Runs before each test file. Jest only sets NODE_ENV=test when it is unset,
// so a shell that already exports NODE_ENV (e.g. after sourcing .env, which
// sets "development") would turn on behaviour the tests rely on being off,
// such as the login rate limiter. Always test as "test".
process.env.NODE_ENV = 'test'
